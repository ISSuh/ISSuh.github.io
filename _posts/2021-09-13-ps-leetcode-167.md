### [ 167. Two Sum II - Input array is sorted ](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/) - Easy

#### 문제

Given an array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

Return the indices of the two numbers (1-indexed) as an integer array answer of size 2, where 1 <= answer[0] < answer[1] <= numbers.length.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

#### 제한사항`

- 2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 104
- -1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000
- numbers is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- -1000 <= target <= 1000
- The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution.

#### 입출력 예

```
Example 1:

Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
```

```
Example 2:

Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
Output: [1,3]
```

```
Example 3:

Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
Output: [1,2]
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& numbers, int target) {
        vector<int> result;
        int left = 0, right = numbers.size() - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            int sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
            if (sum > target) {
                --right;
            } else if (sum < target) {
                ++left;                
            } else {
                result.push_back(left + 1); 
                result.push_back(right + 1);
                break;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

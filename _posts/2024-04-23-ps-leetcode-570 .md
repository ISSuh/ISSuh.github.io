### [ 1768. Merge Strings Alternately ](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-strings-alternately/description/) - Easy

#### 문제

You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

#### 입출력 예

```
Example 1:

Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r
```

```
Example 2:

Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
Output: "apbqrs"
Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b
word2:    p   q   r   s
merged: a p b q   r   s
```

```
Example 3:

Input: word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"
Output: "apbqcd"
Explanation: Notice that as word1 is longer, "cd" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b   c   d
word2:    p   q
merged: a p b q c   d
```

#### 제한사항

- 1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100
- word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters.

#### 풀이

- Two Pointer, String

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    string mergeAlternately(string word1, string word2) {
        std::string word;

        int index = 0;
        while(index < word1.size() || index < word2.size()) {
            if (index < word1.size()) {
                word.push_back(word1[index]);
            }

            if (index < word2.size()) {
                word.push_back(word2[index]);
            }

            ++index;
        }

        return word;
    }
};

func numWaterBottles(numBottles int, numExchange int) int {
    sum := numBottles
    for numBottles / numExchange != 0 {
        drink := numBottles / numExchange
        remainBottle := numBottles % numExchange
        
        sum += drink
        numBottles = drink + remainBottle
    }
    return sum
}
